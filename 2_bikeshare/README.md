# bikeshare
## Introduction
This is the project for me to utilize Pandas and Numpy
## How to use
This repository contains-
1. Three csv files with data for three cities- <i>chicago.csv</i>, <i>new_york_city.csv</i>, <i>washington.csv</i>.
2. One python file written to assess the data in the csv files- <i>bikeshare.py</i>.

To use the project-
1. Place the <i>bikeshare.py</i> file and all the CSV files in the same folder.
2. Run the python in the required environment -- I will recommend run in the PyCharm
## Resources
To complete the project, I used my knowledge which I gained over the course of studying the Python Foundation Nanodegree Program on Udacity.

Reference list 
1. [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)

3. [Tutorials Point](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/)
4. [Pandas Documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.17.0/)
5. I used [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) extensively for quickly running small snippets of code, and [Atom editor](https://atom.io/) for bigger pieces of code.
 I also learnt on how to manipulate the data with advanced Pandas fuction.
